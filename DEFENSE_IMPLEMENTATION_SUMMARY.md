# Defense Visualization - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ FRONTEND CHANGES (COMPLETED)

### New Files Created:
1. **`frontend/src/components/DefenseView.jsx`** - Defense comparison visualization component
2. **`frontend/src/components/DefenseView.css`** - Styling for defense views
3. **`BACKEND_DEFENSE_REQUIREMENTS.md`** - Detailed backend implementation guide

### Modified Files:
1. **`frontend/src/App.jsx`**
   - Imported DefenseView component
   - Added state for baseline/defense results comparison
   - Integrated defense view into results section

2. **`frontend/src/components/ExperimentForm.jsx`**
   - Added defense toggle checkbox
   - Added defense method dropdown (shows when defense enabled)
   - Linked defense config to experiment submission

3. **`frontend/src/components/ExperimentForm.css`**
   - Added styling for defense toggle
   - Added defense info badge styling

## üé® WHAT THE FRONTEND NOW DOES

### 1. Defense Configuration
- Users can toggle "Enable Defense Mechanism" checkbox
- When enabled, they can select defense method:
  - Byzantine-Robust Aggregation
  - Anomaly Detection
  - Gradient Clipping
  - Client Filtering

### 2. Defense Visualization Features
- **Comparison Charts**: Side-by-side accuracy/loss comparison between baseline (no defense) and defense-enabled experiments
- **Impact Summary Cards**: Shows baseline accuracy, defense accuracy, and improvement percentage
- **Attack Mitigation Badge**: Green "‚úì Attack Mitigated" badge when defense improves accuracy
- **Malicious Participant Tracking**:
  - Total malicious clients
  - Training rounds
  - Participation count and rate
  - Per-round influence chart
  - List of identified malicious workers
- **Defense Configuration Display**: Shows active defense method, attack type, selection strategy

### 3. How It Works
1. User runs experiment without defense (baseline)
2. User runs same experiment with defense enabled
3. Frontend automatically detects and compares both results
4. Shows comprehensive comparison and defense effectiveness

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BACKEND CHANGES REQUIRED

See `BACKEND_DEFENSE_REQUIREMENTS.md` for complete implementation guide.

### Quick Summary of Backend TODOs:

1. **`api_server.py`**:
   - Add `enable_defense` and `defense_method` to ExperimentConfig
   - Add DEFENSE_METHODS mapping
   - Update experiment execution logic
   - Add defense stats to results

2. **`server.py`**:
   - Modify `train_subset_of_clients` to apply defense during aggregation
   - Update `run_exp` signature to accept defense params

3. **`federated_learning/utils/defense.py`** (NEW FILE):
   - Implement `byzantine_robust_aggregation()`
   - Implement `clip_and_aggregate()`
   - Implement `detect_anomalies()`

4. **`federated_learning/arguments.py`**:
   - Add `enable_defense` and `defense_method` fields
   - Add getters/setters

## üöÄ HOW TO USE (Once Backend is Updated)

1. Start backend: `python api_server.py`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Run baseline experiment:
   - Configure attack (e.g., replace_1_with_9, 5 poisoned workers)
   - Leave "Enable Defense" unchecked
   - Run experiment
4. Run defense experiment:
   - Same config as baseline
   - Check "Enable Defense"
   - Select defense method (e.g., Byzantine-Robust)
   - Run experiment
5. View comparison:
   - Frontend automatically shows defense effectiveness
   - Charts compare baseline vs defense
   - See malicious participant activity
   - View attack mitigation status

## üìä VISUALIZATION EXAMPLES

The DefenseView component shows:
- **Performance comparison chart**: Overlays baseline and defense accuracy/loss curves
- **Summary cards**: Quick metrics showing improvement
- **Malicious influence chart**: Shows % of malicious participants per round
- **Worker tracking**: Visual grid of identified malicious workers

## üîß NEXT STEPS

1. **Implement backend changes** (see BACKEND_DEFENSE_REQUIREMENTS.md)
2. **Test the flow**:
   - Run baseline experiment
   - Run defense experiment
   - Verify comparison appears
3. **Tune defense algorithms** based on results
4. **Add more defense methods** if needed

## üìù NOTES

- Frontend is fully functional and ready to use
- Backend currently needs to implement defense logic
- The API contract is defined in ExperimentConfig
- Results structure is defined in BACKEND_DEFENSE_REQUIREMENTS.md
- All UI components are styled and responsive
